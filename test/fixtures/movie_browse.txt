The film is okay and not much more than that, the major stumbling block being Marshall's failure to scrub away enough star veneer on Pacino and Pfeiffer to accept them as minimum-wage drones with nowhere to go but toward each other. Fortunately, Marshall's feel for the texture offered by supporting players--Hector Elizondo as a caf\u00e9 owner, Nathan Lane as Pfeiffer's inevitably gay neighbour-buddy, Kate Nelligan as another lonely waitress--keeps things interesting enough.","released":"1991-10-18","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1450,"width":1021,"url":"http://hwcdn.themoviedb.org/posters/051/4c614eaa5e73d63c86000051/frankie-and-johnny-original.jpg","id":"4c614eaa5e73d63c86000051"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":710,"width":500,"url":"http://hwcdn.themoviedb.org/posters/051/4c614eaa5e73d63c86000051/frankie-and-johnny-mid.jpg","id":"4c614eaa5e73d63c86000051"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":263,"width":185,"url":"http://hwcdn.themoviedb.org/posters/051/4c614eaa5e73d63c86000051/frankie-and-johnny-cover.jpg","id":"4c614eaa5e73d63c86000051"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":131,"width":92,"url":"http://hwcdn.themoviedb.org/posters/051/4c614eaa5e73d63c86000051/frankie-and-johnny-thumb.jpg","id":"4c614eaa5e73d63c86000051"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://hwcdn.themoviedb.org/backdrops/c9e/4bc9197b017a3c57fe009c9e/frankie-and-johnny-original.jpg","id":"4bc9197b017a3c57fe009c9e"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://hwcdn.themoviedb.org/backdrops/c9e/4bc9197b017a3c57fe009c9e/frankie-and-johnny-poster.jpg","id":"4bc9197b017a3c57fe009c9e"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://hwcdn.themoviedb.org/backdrops/c9e/4bc9197b017a3c57fe009c9e/frankie-and-johnny-thumb.jpg","id":"4bc9197b017a3c57fe009c9e"}}],"version":36,"last_modified_at":"2010-08-18 22:47:39"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"The Kite Runner","name":"The Kite Runner","alternative_name":"Les Cerfs-volants de Kaboul","movie_type":"movie","id":7979,"imdb_id":"tt0419887","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/7979","votes":5,"rating":9.6,"certification":"","overview":"The Kite Runner is the story of strained family relationships between a father and a son, and between two brothers, how they deal with guilt and forgiveness, and how they weather the political and social transformations of Afghanistan from the 1970s to 2001.
